# Background of the Problem

Credit card is a type of credit creation facility, wherein credit card companies bear the expenditure of user of the card for a period of one month and charge a fee for undertaking the transactional risk. Credit creation also includes the facility of loans that are provided by banking and finance organizations. Both these facilities have given rise to a concept known as credit history and ratings.

A credit history of a person is actually a rating or analysis, in which the personâ€™s creditability or reliability for timely repayment of debts, on or before the due date, is rated. There are separate finance organizations that track and give reports about credit history of a person by contacting all the banks and financial institutions from which the individual has availed credit creation services in past.

A good credit history is achieved by timely repayment of all bills and debts, and is extremely good for availing any other finance service like a loan or credit card. On the other hand, a bad credit history is derived due to delayed or default payment of debts and bills. An individual with a bad credit history, always finds it difficult to avail any kind of credit creation facility. However, some finance and credit organizations, and credit card companies have come with facilities like credit cards even for people with a bad credit history.
